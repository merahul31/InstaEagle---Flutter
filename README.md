.. there is main screen that contains a search box and a bottom navigation bar. You can navigate to the home tab and the settings tab from the bottom navigation bar.

The home screen tab includes a search box where you can search for any Instagram user by using their username.

Once you click on the user's profile, you will be navigated to the next screen where you can download the profile picture into your storage. The file will be stored in your local storage with a folder name 'InstaEagle Downloads'.
You can also open the user's profile into the Instagram app.

### Bug
- The file will instantly download to your phone and you can see it by going to the specific folder i.e 'InstaEagle Downloads'. But it will take some time to show in your gallery app.
